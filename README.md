# Loan-Status-Prediction

The goal of this project is to develop some ML models to predict whether or not a loan application will be approved using various ML predicting Techniques.

# ML Models Used
  1. Linear Support Vector Machine
  2. Random Forest

# Test Accuracy
  1. Linear Support Vector Machine= Accuracy on test data :  0.834
  2. Random Forest= Accuracy on test data :  0.834
